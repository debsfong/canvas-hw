# Introduction to Canvas

This exercise will give you a bit of practice using canvas to draw
shapes on a page.

## Phase I: Setting up your Canvas Element

Take a look at the `index.html` that has been provided for you. Notice
that there is a `canvas` element that has been included in the body.
This is the element that we will be working with. By default, the canvas
element has a width of 300px and a height of 150px.

In the `practice.js` file, we have added an event listener that waits
for the document to be loaded before looking for the canvas element.  

Create a [2D rendering context][CanvasRenderingContext2D] by grabbing
the `canvas` element and then using `getContext`.  

## Phase II: Draw a Rectangle

## Phase III: Draw a Circle
